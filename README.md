# Bayesian Time Series Analysis with Stan

This project demonstrates Bayesian time series modeling using the `Stan` probabilistic programming language. The analysis compares a Bayesian approach to a frequentist time series model, providing insights into the advantages and challenges of Bayesian techniques.

## Overview

The notebook `Time_Series_with_Stan.ipynb` provides a step-by-step guide for comparing the performance of a time series Bayesian model built in `Stan` to its frequentist equivalent.

The primary goals are to:
- Construct a Bayesian model for time series forecasting.
- Compare the Bayesian model's performance with a pre-built frequentist model.
- Share insights about the Bayesian model perspective

## How to Use

1. **Requirements**  
   - R with `rstan`, `tidyverse`, and other supporting libraries.
   - Google Colab (recommended for ease of setup with R and Stan).

2. **Running the Notebook**  
   - Clone this repository and open the notebook in Google Colab.
   - Follow the code and explanations to understand the modeling process and interpret the results.

## Future Directions

Potential extensions of this work could involve:
- Experimenting with different time series models in Stan.
- Exploring alternative priors or model structures.
- Scaling the analysis to more complex time series structures.
